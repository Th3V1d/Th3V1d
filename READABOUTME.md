- 👋 Hi, I’m @Th3V1d
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, basically anything;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in high school, but almost in all of my free time, I'm programming;
- 💞️ I will gladly help on any interesting idea, if I can. I'm really a beginner, so I cannot really do complicated stuff;
- 📫 How to reach me? You can reach out for me on gmail (david.szasz111@gmail.com), or discord Th3V1d#4097;
